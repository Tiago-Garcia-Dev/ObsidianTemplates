# YearCompass 2023 | 2024



# Welcome

---

## What is this?

It’s a YearCompass—your very own YearCompass, to be exact.

It is a booklet [or in this case: Obsidian template] that helps you reflect on the past year and plan the next one. With a set of carefully selected questions and exercises, YearCompass helps you uncover your patterns and design a great year for yourself.

The booklet has two distinct parts. The first half will help you review, learn from, and celebrate the year you’re leaving behind. The second half, on the other hand, is all about the future. You’ll be dreaming, planning, and preparing to get the most out of the new year.

## What do I need to fill out the booklet?

A pen or a pencil, a few hours of uninterrupted focus, and an open and honest mind.

## Can I do this in a group?

Sure you can! Grab your friends, print out booklets for all of them and find a comfortable space. Everyone should fill out their own YearCompass, but you can take breaks to discuss the exercises and share your thoughts and feelings. 

If you do this, please be mindful of your companions’ boundaries. Everyone should only share things they are comfortable with.

# Get ready

---

Arrive.

Prepare your tools and the space around you.

Close your eyes and take five deep breaths.

Let go of your expectations.

Start when you feel ready.
